Interaction Regression Summary
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
Test if pressure sensitivity changed after structural break (Rückrunde).
Interaction terms (is_ruckrunde * pressure_*) test whether pressure coefficients
are different in Rückrunde compared to Hinrunde.

WHAT THE INTERACTION TERMS TEST:
- Negative interaction coefficients: Pressure has LESS impact in Rückrunde
- Positive interaction coefficients: Pressure has MORE impact in Rückrunde

MODELS RUN:
- announced_45: Announced time, 1st half
- announced_90: Announced time, 2nd half
- excess_45: Excess time, 1st half
- excess_90: Excess time, 2nd half
